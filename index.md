  <h1>App for your Veterinary Clinic</h1>
    <p>It's not enough in this day and age to just have a great veterinary clinic.  No matter how great your staff, services, and prices are, and no matter how much you differentiate yourself from your peers, opportunities are slipping through your fingers to serve your clients better.  You need a new tool to encourage your clients to make the most of your amazing business.</p>
    <p>Encourage Marketing builds custom iPhone, iPad, and Android applications for your clinic, branded with your logo and name, and distributed through authorized App Stores.  The apps will be a little reminder of your clinic in your client's pocket, 24 hours a day.  Reach out and communicate with them when you need to, and use our tools to encourage them to come back and spend their valuable dollars on your products and services.</p>

    <h4 class="media-heading">Reward Card <i class="fa fa-gift"></i></h4>
    <p>Encourage your clients to come back to the clinic with a reward card.  Give them a "paw print" for every $75 spent at the clinic, and a discount in the clinic once they fill up a 12 stamp card.  People will drive across town to pick up their food when they know it is veterinary quality, and they'll get a paw print for it.</p>
    <p>Our reward card is very customizable, so that it fits within your business.  We'll give you some advice based upon our experience, but you can choose how many paw prints are required to redeem a reward, and what paw prints are given out for.</p>

    <p>At the push of a button your client can e-mail in a request to book their appointment, making it a low-friction experience to come back in to the clinic every year.</p>

    <p>It's easy for clinic staff, easy for clients, and helps drive more business in the front door.</p>
